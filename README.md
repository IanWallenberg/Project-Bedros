# First project - Project Bedros the Baker 🥐

Link to project - https://bedros-baker-site.netlify.app

My first project is a portfolio for my friend and coworker Bedros Kabranien<br>
I wanted to create a website for people to browse through and see his baked creations, read about his different baking classes, and send class inquiries to him if interested

I got to learn a lot about how to work with HTML and CSS, and started my journey with JavaScript as well<br>
This project was made during 16/8 to 8/10 (and uploaded 18/2 -2022)

It was a very challenging experience, but nevertheless fun<br>
I got to learn by doing, and understand my way of working with code more<br>
I haven't revisited the work to keep it as a relic in time, but I will continue working with this project when it becomes more actual, as it was a trial experiment <br>
