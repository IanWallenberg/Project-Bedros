# First project - Project Bedros 🥐 🥐 🥐
My first project is a portfolio for my friend and coworker Bedros Kabranien
I got to learn a lot about how to work with HTML and CSS, and started my journey with JavaScript
This project was made during 16/8 to 8/10

It was a very challenging experience, but nevertheless fun
I got to learn by doing, and understand my way of working with code more
I haven't revisited the work to keep it as a relic in time, but I will continue working with this project when it becomes more actual, as it was a trial experiment 🥐 🥐 🥐
