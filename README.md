# First project - Project Bedros the Baker 🥐 🥐 🥐
My first project is a portfolio for my friend and coworker Bedros Kabranien
I wanted to create a website for people to browse through his baked creations, reading about his different courses, and sending class inquiries to him
I got to learn a lot about how to work with HTML and CSS, and started my journey with JavaScript as well
This project was made during 16/8 to 8/10 (and uploaded 18/2 -2022)

It was a very challenging experience, but nevertheless fun
I got to learn by doing, and understand my way of working with code more
I haven't revisited the work to keep it as a relic in time, but I will continue working with this project when it becomes more actual, as it was a trial experiment 🥐 🥐 🥐
